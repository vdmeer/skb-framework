        This scenario will  create  all  required  artifacts  for  building  a
        framework distributions. It can be used in the `dev` application mode,
        though the framework should be started  with  option  `--all-mode`  to
        catch all tasks. It also requires the  flavor  _install_  being  used,
        using the start option `--install` or `-I`.  The  scenario  calls  the
        tasks `build-manual` and `build-help`. Since it builds all  artifacts,
        it has all requirements as these two tasks, including JRE8  (for  tool
        execution).
