        Sets the command to start a new X terminal (Xterm)  with  substitution
        strings for title  and  command.  The  title  substitution  string  is
        `%TITLE%`. The command substitution string is `%COMMAND%`. For most  X
        terminals, it is best to use an open ended CLI option for the program,
        i.e. a CLI option that takes everything until the end of  the  command
        line. Most X terminal variants can be started using `xterm -T  %TITLE%
        -e %COMMAND%`. For `mintty` on Cygwin this variable should be  `mintty
        -t %TITLE% %COMMAND%`. For an XFCE4 terminal,  e.g.  on  Ubuntu,  this
        variable should be `xfce4-terminal --disable-server  --title='%TITLE%'
        -x %COMMAND%`.
