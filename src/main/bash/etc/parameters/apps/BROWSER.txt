        Sets the command to start a web browser, for instance Firefox, with  a
        URL. The setting should contain the  string  `%URL%`,  which  will  be
        substituted with the actual URL at  runtime.  To  start  for  instance
        Firefox, this variable should be set to `firefox --new-tab %URL%`. The
        browser can be given as simple command (then it needs  to  be  in  the
        `PATRH`) or as absolute command.
