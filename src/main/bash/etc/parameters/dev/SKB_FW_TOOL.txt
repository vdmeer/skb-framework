        This option points  to  the  SKB  Framework  Tool.  This  tool  is  an
        executable JAR. It is  used  to  convert  paragraphs  and  lists  into
        justified text with pre-defined margins and other parameters. This  is
        done using the SKB _asciiparagraph_ and  _asciilist_  implementations.
        This setting is required to build the manual sources (text files) from
        the original ADOC files. In a standard installation, the JAR  will  be
        available in the `bin/java` folder of the framework.
