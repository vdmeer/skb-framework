The SKB-Framework provides a flexible, metadata-driven automation framework.
Its main objective is to load and provide flexible access to _tasks_.
A task is a shell script with additional semantics (metadata) processed by the framework.
These additional semantics allow the framework to take care of some common functions for defined tasks,
    for example loading and evaluating parameters and dependencies.

The framework itself provides a start script, a loader, and an interactive shell.
The start script sets initial parameters, such as name, acronym for name, path to an installation.
The loader will process specifications (mainly tasks) and validate them.
Once the loader is satisfied, it will start the interactive shell.

An application using the framework can be started in one of three different modes:
`dev` for a development mode,
`build` for a build mode, and
`use` for a use mode.
The development mode `dev` should load tasks required to develop an application.
The build mode `build` should load tasks required to build artifacts for a given application.
The use mode `use` should load tasks required to use built artifacts for a given application.

An application can also run in two different flavors:
`std` or _standard_ for the standard flavor, and
`install` for the installation flavor.
Almost all tasks are visible in the `std` flavor.
Only specific tasks, required when installing an application, are limited to the `install` flavor.

The framework provides definitions for seven different elements: tasks, their dependencies, their (configuration) parameters, application CLI options, shell commands, application error codes, and scenarios.
The framework loader will load all those definitions and validate them based on the provided metadata.
CLI options, commands, and error codes are handled by the framework itself.
Tasks, dependencies, parameters, and scenarios can be defined by an application.
This framework provides a basic set of tasks, dependencies, and parameters.
It also defines some scenarios to build its own deployment artifacts.

This software package also provides an application named `skb-framework` as a standard application utilizing the framework's features and tasks.
