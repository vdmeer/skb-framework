The SKB-Framework provides a flexible, metadata-driven application framework.
Its main objective is to load and provide flexible access to tasks.
A task is a shell script with additional semantics processed by the framework.
These additional semantics allow the framework to take care of some common functions for defined tasks, for example loading and evluating parameters and dependencies.
+
The framework itself provides a loader and an interactive shell.
The loader will process specifications (mainly tasks) and validate them.
Once the loader is satisfied, it will start an interactive shell.
+
An application using the framework can be started in one of three different modes:
`dev` for a development mode,
`build` for a build mode, and
`use` for a use mode.
The development mode should load tasks required to develop an application.
The build mode should load tasks required to build artifacts for a given application.
The use mode should load tasks required to use built artifacts for a given application.
+
The framework provides definitions for seven different elements: tasks, their dependencies, their (configuration) parameters, application CLI options, shell commands, application exit status codes, and scenarios.
The framework loader will load all those definitions and validate them based on the provided metadata.
CLI options, commands, and exit status codes are handled by the framework itself.
Tasks, dependencies, parameters, and scenarios can be defined by an application.
This framework provides a basic set of tasks, dependencies, and parameters.
It also defines some scenarios to build its own deployment artifacts.
+
This software package also provides an application named `skb-framework` as a standard application utilizing the framework's features and tasks.
