This framework and the application provided here provide an extensible, metadata-driven environment to execute tasks written as shell scripts.
The framework takes care of some standard functionality for tasks, for example external dependencies, configuration parameters of various types, and combining tasks into scenarios.
+
The framework is build for three main concepts: elements, modes, and an interactive shell.
Application elements are tasks (executing functionality), parameters (for configuring tasks), dependencies (to specify dependencies if tasks to external software), scenarios (to provide sequences of task executions).
They are supported by the framework elements of options (command line options to direct behavior), shell commands (basic commands for the interactive application shell), and standardized exit status codes.
A framework application can be started in three different modes:
`dev` for development tasks of an application,
`build` for build or compile aspects of an application, or
`use` for use aspects of an application. Tasks can be defined for one or more of these application modes.
Finally, an application can be started in an interactive mode, using the provided shell.
In this mode, tasks can be executed using the shell.
