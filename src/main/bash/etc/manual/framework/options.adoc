The application provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) in form of options to direct its basic behavior. 
These options can be categorized as option that provide information or execute behavior and exit (exit options) or as options that direct runtime behavior (runtime or run options). 
Any option, or configuration, that goes beyond basic behavior can be configured using parameters.
