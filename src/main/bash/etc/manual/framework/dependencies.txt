    Dependencies are specified to signify dependencies of  tasks  to  external
    programs and software packages. The  framework  defines  a  set  of  basic
    dependencies, for instance Java JDK, Python 3,  or  Asciidoctor.  Concrete
    applications can define their own dependencies. Tasks can then  require  a
    dependency, which will be tested on application start.
