    Tasks are the application  elements  providing  most  of  the  application
    functionality. The framework, and all its applications, allows to add  any
    task with any functions using  a  very  simple  API.  The  core  framework
    provides a set of tasks for the framework. Concrete applications  can  add
    any task for application specific functions. Tasks can define requirements
    in terms of dependencies and parameters and other important aspects.  They
    can also be specified for a specific application mode, i.e. one of  `dev`,
    `build`, and / or `use`.
