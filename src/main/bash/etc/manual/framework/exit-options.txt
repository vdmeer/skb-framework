    Exit options for the application will produce a requested outcome and then
    the  application  will  exit.  Some  of  these  options  are  to   provide
    information,  e.g.  show  the  current  configuration   or   describe   an
    application element. Other options actually will execute a  behavior,  for
    instance execute a task or a scenario and then exit. This  later  category
    can be used to script more complex scenarios by  calling  the  application
    multiple times executing different behavior.
