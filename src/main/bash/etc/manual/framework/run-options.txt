    Runtime options direct the runtime behavior of the  application.  Most  of
    these options set the initial behavior for the application,  for  instance
    the output level of loader, shell, or tasks;  the  shell  prompt;  or  the
    print mode. Most runtime options can be also altered  at  runtime,  except
    for the options setting the application mode.
