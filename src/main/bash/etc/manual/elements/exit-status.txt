    The framework defines a number of standardized exit  status  codes.  These
    codes are the numeric exit values of  the  application,  the  loader,  the
    shell, or any task. Each numeric value is associated to a particular error
    and error description.                                                    

    Error  status  codes  below  20  are  fatal,  they  will  require  special
    attention. Error codes between 20 and 49 point to configuration  problems.
    Error codes between 50 and 59 point to basic problems in a task,  probably
    a bug. Error codes from 60 and above are task-specific. They usually point
    to task usage or configuration problems.
