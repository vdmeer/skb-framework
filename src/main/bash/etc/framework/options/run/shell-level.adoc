This sets the output level for the application shell.
The level can be set to:
+
* off (only messages),
* all (output everything),
* fatal (only fatal errors),
* error (all errors),
* warn-strict (errors and strict warnings),
* warn (all errors and warnings),
* info (errors, warnings, and information),
* debug (information plus debug information),
* or trace (debug plus trace information).
+
The shell level can be changed at runtime using the task `setting`.
To turn off all print outs from the shell also use the options `--tq` and `--snp`.
