        This sets the output level for the application loader. The  level  can
        be set to one of: off (only messages), all (output everything),  fatal
        (only fatal errors),  error  (all  errors),  warn-strict  (errors  and
        strict warnings),  warn  (all  errors  and  warnings),  info  (errors,
        warnings,   and   information),   debug   (information   plus    debug
        information), or trace (debug plus trace information). To turn off all
        print outs from the loader also use the option `--lq`.
