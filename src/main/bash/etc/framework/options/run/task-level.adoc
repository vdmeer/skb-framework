This sets the output level for all tasks. 
The level can be set to one of: off (no output at all), all (output everything), fatal (only fatal errors), error (all errors), warn-strict (errors and strict warnings), warn (all errors and warnings), info (errors, warnings, and information), debug (information plus debug information), or trace (debug plus trace information). 
The task level can be changed at runtime using the task `setting`. 
To turn off all print outs from tasks also use the option `--tq`.
