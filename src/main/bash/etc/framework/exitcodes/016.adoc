Unknown base name or flavor. 
The start script is used for multiple programs. 
At the beginning of the initialization, it detects the current flavor (using the script name). 
If the flavor found is not known, it will exit with this status.
This should not happen in an installed version. 
If it does, than the installation was broken (build) or manipulated (after installation).
