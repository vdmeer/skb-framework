        Parameter documentation is missing. This is a  development  error,  or
        bug. It is detected during initialization, when  the  availability  of
        documentation for parameters is tested while parameters  are  defined.
        The documentation is used for the manpage, the user manual, as well as
        for the manual the program can print at runtime.
