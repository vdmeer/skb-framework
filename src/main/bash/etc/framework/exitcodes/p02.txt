        The temporary configuration file the program uses  to  share  settings
        between shell and  tasks  already  exists.  This  means  that  another
        instance of this program (or a program using  the  same  configuration
        file) is running. Check if the existing file should be used and  start
        with CLI option `--force`. If not, then change  the  setting  for  the
        temporary configuration file. See  parameters  for  details.  In  rare
        occasions, when the program  terminates  suddenly,  the  configuration
        might not have  been  removed.  In  those  cases,  please  remove  the
        temporary configuration file and start the program again.
