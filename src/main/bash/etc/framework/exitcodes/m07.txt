        During initialization, all parameters for directories are tested.  One
        or more of those tests failed. This can happen for parameters that  do
        not (but should) point to a (readable) directory. It can  also  happen
        for directories that will be created if they do  not  exist,  and  the
        creation failed. In any case, detailed error message  will  have  been
        printed.
