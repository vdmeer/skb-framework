        Internal error: configuration test script not  found.  The  shell  and
        every task need a script to test the configuration. They  are  looking
        for this script when started. The location of the  script  is  in  the
        home directory `bin/__test-cfg.sh`. In the simplest case, the shell or
        a task was started outside the program.  Simple  use  the  program  to
        start shell or tasks. If the program was used, then  the  installation
        is broken. Either the script does not exist, or it is not  executable.
        In both cases, the installation needs to be fixed.
