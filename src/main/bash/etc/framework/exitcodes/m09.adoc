One of the last steps of the initialization is to test for required external dependencies. 
Most of them will have been defined by the tasks the program did load earlier. 
This error code is used when one or more of those dependencies could not be found. 
Note: the program will only terminate with the error code when the CLI option `--dependencies` is used. 
In any other cases, tasks that require a dependency that is missing will simply (and quietly) be disabled.
