Shows the history of shell commands. 
Each command, once executed, is automatically added to the history, if the previous command was not exactly the same. 
The history accepts an optional parameter _NUMBER_. 
When a number (an integer) is given, the command with that number in the history will be executed. 
If the number does not exist in the history, an error is printed.
