        Available tasks (from `bin/tasks` in the program home  directory)  are
        loaded. Several tests are run for each task while loading. If  any  of
        those tests failed, this error code will be used on  exit.  Any  error
        here is a development issue (or bug).  Detailed  error  messages  with
        have been printed.                                                    

        A  setting  that  was  marked  as  required  was  not   found   during
        initialization. A more detailed error message will have been  printed,
        e.g. naming the missing parameter or parameters.                      

        During initialization, all parameters for directories are tested.  One
        or more of those tests failed. This can happen for parameters that  do
        not (but should) point to a (readable) directory. It can  also  happen
        for directories that will be created if they do  not  exist,  and  the
        creation failed. In any case, detailed error message  will  have  been
        printed.
