        Internal error: unresolved CLI options. This error points to a bug  in
        the software. It means that the shell or a task  were  presented  with
        unexpected CLI options. Those options should have  been  processed  by
        the program.                                                          
                                                                              
        The program detected an unknown argument in the command line. Some CLI
        optiont (or argument) was used that the program does  not  understand.
        If `--help` does not show this option, than it is unknown. If the help
        screen does show the options, than there is a bug in the software.
