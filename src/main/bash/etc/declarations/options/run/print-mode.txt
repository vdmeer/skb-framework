        Sets the print mode for the application (loader,  shell,  tasks).  The
        print  mode  directs  how  messages,  errors,  warnings,   and   other
        information are printed to the console.  It  can  be  set  to:  `ansi`
        (color and effects are printed using ANSI escape codes), `text` (plain
        text output), or  `adoc`  (Asciidoctor  style  annotated  text).  This
        setting can be changed at runtime using the task `setting`.
