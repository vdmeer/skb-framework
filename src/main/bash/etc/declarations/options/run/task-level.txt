        This sets the output level for all tasks. The level can be set to:    
          * off (only messages),                                              
          * all (output everything),                                          
          * fatal (only fatal errors),                                        
          * error (all errors),                                               
          * warn-strict (errors and strict warnings),                         
          * warn (all errors and warnings),                                   
          * info (errors, warnings, and information),                         
          * debug (information plus debug information),                       
          * or trace (debug plus trace information).                          

        The task level can be changed at runtime using the task `setting`.  To
        turn off all print outs from tasks also use the option `--tq`.
