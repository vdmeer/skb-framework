        Sets the cache directory, used by the task `build-cache` and then also
        the loader. Caching parts of the application  elements  (or  even  all
        tasks) can speed up the load of an  application  as  well  as  runtime
        behavior, such as help on a task. This feature is  useful  for  slower
        systems, such as a Raspberry PI or a Cygwin environment.
