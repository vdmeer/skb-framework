        This parameter should provide a list of directories  that  contain  an
        `skb-ts.id` file  to  run  task  sets.  Use  whitespaces  to  separate
        directories. Tasks that run task sets, such as `make-arget-sets`  will
        use this parameter to find the identifier files. If not present, these
        tasks will not execute.
