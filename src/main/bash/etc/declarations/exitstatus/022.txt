        The loader did not find  a  required  version  file,  for  either  the
        application or the framework. The application version file  should  be
        `$APP_HOME/etc/version.txt`. The  framework  version  file  should  be
        `$FW_HOME/etc/version.txt`. Each of these file must contain  a  single
        line with the version, usually using semantic versioning.  This  error
        points to an application bug or installation error.
