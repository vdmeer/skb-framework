        This task will run targets on so called Target Sets (TS). It  requires
        a file `skb-ts.id` to define the target set  and  an  associated  file
        `skb-ts-scripts.skb` with the function to run.  The  task  then  takes
        required targets as argument and runs them in  the  right  order.  The
        target sets need to be provided by he parameter `RUN_TARGET_SETS`.
