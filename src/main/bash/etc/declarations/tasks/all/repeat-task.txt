        This task will repeat a given task. The repetition can  be  configured
        in terms of: `times` (how often to re-run the task)  and  `wait`  (how
        long to wait between repetitions).  The  task,  including  parameters,
        should be provided after `--` in the command  line.  For  example,  to
        repeat the task `t1` 5 times, use: `repeat-task --times 5 -- t1`.
