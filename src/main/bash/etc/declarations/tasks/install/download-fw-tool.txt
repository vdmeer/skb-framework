        This task downloads the SKB Framework Tool  using  `curl`  or  `wget`.
        This tool is an executable Java JAR file. It  provides  mechanisms  to
        convert plain text into formatted text. The tool is for instance  used
        by the task `build-manual` to  convert  ADOC  sources  into  formatted
        plain text.                                                           

        The task takes the value of the parameter `SKB_FRAMEWORK_TOOL` as file
        name. The JAR file is published on Bintray in  a  generic  repository.
        The     download     URL     without     the     file     name     is:
        https://dl.bintray.com/vdmeer/generic/ .
