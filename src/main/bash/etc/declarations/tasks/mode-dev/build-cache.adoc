This task builds a cache for an application with various options for targets.
It uses the parameter `CACHE_DIR` for the cache location.
A cache of application elements can speed-up the loader.
A cache of task can speed-up the help function of tasks.
While on native UNIX/LINUX system on good-powered machine the cache might not make much of a difference, on other machines it will improve the application's runtime behavior.
