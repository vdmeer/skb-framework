        Prints the current configuration as a  simple  list  of  configuration
        keys and their current value. Some of the keys are internally set, for
        some the values are taken from  the  environment  or  a  configuration
        file. In print mode `ansi`, some values are printed in color (e.g. red
        for a value `error`) or text effects (e.g. bold for the  flavor).  The
        task `list-configuration`  provides  more  options  for  printing  the
        configuration.
