        Executes an API function. The whole  command  line  is  taken  as  the
        argument. The first word in the  argument  must  be  an  existing  API
        function. This command does  not  support  strings  as  arguments.  If
        strings are required, they need to be separated  by  a  non-whitespace
        character. For instance, instead of calling `PrintColor  red  "1  2"`,
        use `PrintColor red 1-2` or `PrintColor red 1#2`.
