        This task changes version information in source file headers. It  runs
        Apache ANT using a simple build script, which in turn  calls  a  macro
        that changes the version line.  The  default  build  and  macro  files
        change java files and all relevant framework files. These files can be
        used as template for writing other substitutions, if required.
