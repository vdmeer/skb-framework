        This tasks builds  the  application  manual.  It  comes  with  various
        options for targets (manual formats)  and  filters  (manual  content).
        There are two primary targets: `text` and `adoc`. Here, `text` can  be
        ANSI text (with colors  and  effects),  plain  text  (just  text),  or
        annotated text (using  ASCII  characters  for  some  formatting).  The
        `adoc` target creates an Asciidoctor file. This file is then  used  to
        create secondary targets, such as a manpage, a HTML  file,  or  a  PDF
        file. Other secondary targets can  be  added,  as  long  as  they  are
        supported by the Asciidoctor tool chain.                              

        Filters can be used to select which content  should  be  part  of  the
        produced manual. All filters apply to all selected targets.           

        There are further options for dependencies, parameters, and tasks. For
        instance: the manual can include all tasks or only tasks loaded in the
        current application mode.                                             

        A special target  is  called  `src`.  This  target  allows  to  create
        well-formatted text paragraphs from the  original  ADOC  source.  This
        option uses the SKB Framework Tool for the translation.
