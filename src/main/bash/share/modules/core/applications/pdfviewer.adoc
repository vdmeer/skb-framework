Sets the command to start a PDF viewer with a given PDF file.
The setting should contain the string `%%`, which will be substituted with the PDF file at runtime.
To start for instance Evince, this variable should be set to `evince %FILE%`.
The PDF viewer can be given as simple command (then it needs to be in the `PATRH`) or as absolute command.
