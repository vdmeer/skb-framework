Tasks are the application elements providing most of the application functionality.
The framework, and all its applications, allows to add any task with any functions using a very simple API.
The core framework provides a set of tasks for the framework.
Concrete applications can add any task for application specific functions.

Tasks can define requirements in terms of dependencies and parameters and other important aspects.
Task runtime visibility can be limited to an application _mode_ and a runtime _flavor_.
So tasks can be visible in either of the application modes `dev`, `build`, and `use`
(or any combination of them).
Furthermore, tasks can be associated with the flavor _std_ (standard) or _install_.
The _install_ flavor should only be required when generating distributions or installations.
Tasks here will create the manual, compile text, or create the application cache.
