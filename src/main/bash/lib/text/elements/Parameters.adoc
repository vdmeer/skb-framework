Parameters can be used to provide specific configurations for tasks, independent of application CLI options.
They can be specified independently of which task will or should use them.
The framework API provides several ways to auto-process a parameter, for example being a file, a directory, a set of files, or a set of directories.
Parameters, once specified, can be required by tasks as mandatory (must be set) or optional (might be set).

All parameters are specified without an application flavor.
For instance, the parameter `TARGET` is specified in the framework.
Any application (and related task) using it will use the flavor prefix of the application to set its value.
This mechanism allows to use application specific settings the the same parameter, in our example `TARGET`.
