== System Configuration
Running the framework does not require special system configurations with two exceptions:

* All output of the framework may (will) use UTF-8 characters.
* In the default setting, the framework will run in the _print_mode_ _ansi_ using colors and font (bold, italic) to emphasize parts of the output.

So you will need to have a terminal capable of presenting UTF-8 characters in any case,
    and a terminal capable to show colors and special fonts for the default _print mode_.
Both settings depend on the terminal (or console) you are using, sometimes also on its settings.
Critical terminal settings are then the font used (should be UTF-8 capable) and the ability to show colors.

The SKB-Web maintains information on how to configure UTF-8 and ASNI support.
Please see the following links for further details:
