==  Counters()
_mixed Counters( $1, $2 )_ - actions on/with counters.

This function runs the requested action (_$1_) on a counter (_$2_).
Depending on the action, the function might return an integer.
Supported actions are:

* _get_ - This will return the current value of the counter, an integer.
* _increase_ - This will increase the counter by _1_.
    Nothing is returned.
* _reset_ - This will reset the counter to _0_.
    Nothing is returned.

The framework maintains counters for each part of the process: loader, shell, and tasks.
This function will use _CONFIG_MAP["RUNNING_IN"]_ to determine in which part it is called and select the appropriate counter.
For each part, the following counters are supported:

* _errors_ - the number of detected errors.
* _warnings_ - the number of detected warnings.


*Parameters*

* `$1` - _String_ - action to run, one of: get, increase, rest.
* `$2` - _String_ - the counter for the action, one of: errors, warnings.


*Return*

* _void_ for the actions increase and reset.
*_integer_ with the current setting of the requested counter for the action get.
    This return is realized as print.


*Errors*

* For an unknown action
* For an unknown counter


*Internal Dependencies*

* {blank}
include::{skb-site-main-dir}/doc/fragments/developer-guide/api/function-links/consoleprint-link.adoc[]
for throwing errors.
