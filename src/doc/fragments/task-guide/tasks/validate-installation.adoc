== validate-installation
This task validates an installation.
For each target, it will test the following conditions:

* All required or configured directories are available and readable
* All required files are available and readable
* All declarations have documentation files
* For directories with known content, e.g. task binaries, no extra files to exist

The task will issue errors for serious problems.
It will issue strict warnings for problems that should not have an impact on the application at runtime (for example extra files in a directory).
It can also issue warnings for less significant problems.

When the option _strict_ is used, all strict warnings become errors.
The _strict_ mode is useful to validate an installation before packaging an application.
