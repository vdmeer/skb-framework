This guide provides details for all tasks of the framework.
The tasks are described in three categories:

* Use Tasks - these tasks are mainly directed at the application mode _use_.
* Build Tasks - these tasks are mainly directed at the application mode _builde_.
    They do build artifacts or compile source files to build artifacts.
* Development Tasks - these tasks are mainly directed at the application mode _dev_.
    They provide functionality required to develop and application or to build important runtime artifacts for an application.

A task in the framework is essentially a _bash_ script that benefits from provided functions of the framework, such as loading and testing dependencies or parameters.
By convention, each task should provide an argument `-h` or `--help`, which shows its arguments.
For simple tasks, the description in this guide does no go beyond what this help and the online help (or manual) already provides.
One of those tasks is _wait_.

For more complex tasks, with either a lot of arguments or special configuration requirements, this guide provides all details required to use the task.
One of those tasks is `build-mvn-site`, which not only has a rather complex process but also requires additional metadata for sites to exist.

For details on how to develop and write a task please see the developer guide.
This document focuses only on how to use tasks.
