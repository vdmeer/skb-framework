*-A*, *--all-mode* - run application in mode 'all':: 
Starts the application in the mode `all`.
In this mode, all tasks are loaded and no mode restrictions on the tasks are evaluated.
This option is overwritten by the options `--build-mode` and `--dev-mode`.


*-B*, *--build-mode* - run application in mode 'build':: 
Starts the application in the mode `build`.
In this mode, only tasks marked for `build` mode are loaded.
This option is overwritten by the option `--dev-mode`.


*-D*, *--dev-mode* - run application in mode 'dev':: 
Starts the application in the mode `dev`.
In this mode, only tasks marked for `dev` mode are loaded.


*-L*, *--loader-level* LEVEL - sets console level for the loader:: 
This sets the output level for the application loader.
The level can be set to:
+
* off (only messages),
* all (output everything),
* fatal (only fatal errors),
* error (all errors),
* warn-strict (errors and strict warnings),
* warn (all errors and warnings),
* info (errors, warnings, and information),
* debug (information plus debug information),
* or trace (debug plus trace information). 
+
To turn off all print outs from the loader also use the option `--lq`.


*--lq* - quiet loader, no messages from loader:: 
Puts the application loader into quiet mode.
Here, the loader will not print any messages.
Other output might still be printed, see `--loader-level`.


*-P*, *--print-mode* MODE - sets the print mode: ansi, text, text-anon:: 
Sets the print mode for the application (loader, shell, tasks).
The print mode directs how messages, errors, warnings, and other information are printed to the console.
It can be set to: `ansi` (color and effects are printed using ANSI escape codes), `text` (plain text output), or `adoc` (Asciidoctor style annotated text).
This setting can be changed at runtime using the task `setting`.


*-r*, *--run-scenario* FILE - run shell commands from scenario file:: 
Runs a scenario from a file, i.e. the commands in the scenario file.
The file is automatically loaded from the scenario directory.
The file extension is optional.


*-S*, *--shell-level* LEVEL - sets console level for the shell:: 
This sets the output level for the application shell.
The level can be set to:
+
* off (only messages),
* all (output everything),
* fatal (only fatal errors),
* error (all errors),
* warn-strict (errors and strict warnings),
* warn (all errors and warnings),
* info (errors, warnings, and information),
* debug (information plus debug information),
* or trace (debug plus trace information).
+
The shell level can be changed at runtime using the task `setting`.
To turn off all print outs from the shell also use the options `--tq` and `--snp`.


*--snp* - shell-no-prompt: switch off shell prompt:: 
Turns off the shell prompt, i.e. the shell will not print a prompt if this option is used.
The shell level can be changed at runtime using the task `setting`.


*--sq* - quiet shell, no messages from shell:: 
Puts the application shell into quiet mode.
Here, the shell will not print any messages.
Other output might still be printed, see `--shell-level` and `--snp`.


*-s*, *--strict* - most warnings are treated as errors:: 
Runs the program in `strict` mode.
Here, all missing task dependencies are treated as errors.
Errors cause the program to fail initialization.
If not in strict mode, missing task dependencies result in the respective task not being loaded.


*-T*, *--task-level* LEVEL - sets console level for tasks:: 
This sets the output level for all tasks.
The level can be set to:
+
* off (only messages),
* all (output everything),
* fatal (only fatal errors),
* error (all errors),
* warn-strict (errors and strict warnings),
* warn (all errors and warnings),
* info (errors, warnings, and information),
* debug (information plus debug information),
* or trace (debug plus trace information).
+
The task level can be changed at runtime using the task `setting`.
To turn off all print outs from tasks also use the option `--tq`.


*--tq* - quiet tasks, no messages from tasks:: 
Puts the tasks into quiet mode.
Here, tasks will not print any messages.
Other output might still be printed, see `--task-level`.
